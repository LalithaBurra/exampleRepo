# example Repo
This is my **first repos**. 
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
## About this file 
I am working along with _Emily_ and the rest of my *classmates*.  
I am learning about GitHub and it's markdowns.  
Markdowns are text formatting.  
markdown syntaxes are listed in the file named **markdownsList**.
