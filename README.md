> ## About this file 
I am working along with _Emily_ and the rest of my *classmates*.  
I am learning about GitHub and it's markdowns.  
Markdowns are text formatting.  

> Markdowns

**1. *new line***: use 2 blank spaces after the sentence and hit Enter. Ex: [blank space][blank space][Enter]  
**2. *Heading*** is with a hashtag, the title and Enter  
**3. *h1,h2,h3 hierarchies*** are #, ##, ###, etc  
**4. _Italicizing_** the text is either by single star *encapsulating the text* or underscore _encapsulating the text_.  
**5. _Quote_**: is done with a  >  symbol before the text.
