This is my **first repos**. 
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
## About this file 
I am working along with _Emily_ and the rest of my *classmates*.  
I am learning about GitHub and it's markdowns.  
Markdowns are text formatting.  
*new line*: use 2 blank spaces after the sentence and hit Enter. Ex: [blank space][blank space][Enter]  
*Heading* is with a hashtag, the title and Enter  
*h1,h2,h3 hierarchies* are #, ##, ###, etc  
_Italicizing_ the text is either by single star *encapsulating the text* or underscore _encapsulating the text_.
